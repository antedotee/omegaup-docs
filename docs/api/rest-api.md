# omegaUp REST API

omegaUp provides a comprehensive REST API that can be accessed directly. All endpoints use standard HTTP methods (`GET` or `POST`) and return JSON-formatted responses.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with:

```
https://omegaup.com/api/
```

In this documentation, only the part of the URL **after** this prefix is shown.

## Authentication

!!! warning "HTTPS Required"
    Only HTTPS connections are allowed. HTTP requests will return `HTTP 301 Permanent Redirect`.

Some endpoints are public and require no authentication. Protected endpoints require authentication via an `auth_token` obtained from the [`user/login`](users.md#login) endpoint.

The token must be included in a cookie named `ouat` (omegaUp Auth Token) for authenticated requests.

!!! important "Single Session"
    omegaUp supports only one active session at a time. Logging in programmatically will invalidate your browser session, and vice versa.

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Error message",
  "errorcode": 400
}
```

## Example: Get Server Time

This is a public endpoint that doesn't require authentication:

**Request:**
```bash
GET https://omegaup.com/api/time/get/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "time": 1436577101,
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### Endpoint Details

**`GET time/get/`**

Returns the current UNIX timestamp according to the server's internal clock. Useful for synchronizing local clocks.

| Field   | Type   | Description                                      |
|---------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| status  | string | Returns `"ok"` if the request was successful |
| time    | int    | UNIX timestamp representing the server time      |

**Required Permissions:** None

## Rate Limiting

Some endpoints have rate limits:

- **Submissions**: One submission per problem every 60 seconds
- **API Calls**: Varies by endpoint

Rate limit exceeded responses:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "errorcode": 429
}
```
