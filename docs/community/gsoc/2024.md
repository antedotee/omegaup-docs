## Completed Projects

### Migrate Problem Creator to Vue.js + TypeScript

**Contributor**: [Aritra Chakraborty](https://github.com/Aritra8438)

**Description**:
The Problem Creator is a visual editor that helps problem authors create and edit omegaUp problems more easily. Previously hosted externally, this project migrated the entire application to Vue.js + TypeScript for seamless integration into omegaUp.com.

**Key Achievements**:

- Migrated the entire Problem Creator codebase to Vue.js 3 with TypeScript
- Implemented a modern, reactive UI with improved user experience
- Added support for all problem components: statements, test cases, validators
- Created comprehensive documentation for problem authors
- Integrated with omegaUp's existing problem format specifications

**Technical Stack**:

- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vuetify for UI components
- Jest for testing

**Impact**:
Problem Creator can now be used directly on omegaUp.com without needing an external website. This streamlines the problem creation workflow significantly.

**Description**:
This project enabled GitHub-based management of public course content, allowing community contributions through pull requests. The Mexican Olympiad in Informatics had pioneered this approach, and this project replicated it for omegaUp's own courses.

**Key Achievements**:

- Set up GitHub repositories for public course content
- Created CI/CD pipelines for automatic course deployment
- Implemented validation workflows for course content
- Enabled community contributions via pull requests
- Documented the workflow for course maintainers

**Technical Stack**:

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Python for content processing
- REST APIs for omegaUp integration

**Impact**:
Course content can now be improved through community pull requests, democratizing the educational content creation process.
